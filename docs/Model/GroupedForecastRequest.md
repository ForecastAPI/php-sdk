# # GroupedForecastRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**identifier** | **string** | Names the measure being forecast (e.g. \&quot;mrr\&quot;). The hierarchy&#39;s total is stored under this identifier exactly like a plain /v2/forecast for it — the total of the hierarchy IS the measure. |
**tenant_context** | **string** | Optional tenant scope, independent of segment — tenancy keeps meaning \&quot;whose data is this\&quot;, segment means \&quot;which slice\&quot;. | [optional]
**hierarchy** | **string[]** | The dimensions of the hierarchy, outermost first. Each series&#39; segment must name exactly these dimensions. |
**reconciliation** | **string** | - bottom_up (default): only the leaves are forecast; every aggregate is the   exact sum of its children. Fast and cheap; best when leaf histories are   substantial enough to forecast well on their own. - min_trace: every node — aggregates included — is forecast, then MinTrace   optimally redistributes the disagreement between levels into a coherent set.   Costs one forecast per node, but lets the usually-smoother aggregate series   inform the result, which tends to help when leaves are short or noisy.  top_down is not supported and is rejected by name. | [optional] [default to 'bottom_up']
**correlation** | **float** | bottom_up only — the assumed correlation between sibling errors when building aggregate confidence bands. 0 &#x3D; independent siblings, 1 &#x3D; perfectly correlated (equivalent to summing the bounds). Echoed back in the response and never labelled as measured. | [optional] [default to 0.5]
**frequency** | **string** | Data frequency, shared by every series in the hierarchy |
**periods** | **int** | Number of periods to forecast, shared by every node |
**data_type** | **string** | Type of data (e.g., sales, demand, revenue). Sales-family types get non-negative reconciliation treatment. | [optional] [default to 'sales']
**model** | **string** | Forecasting engine used for every node | [optional] [default to 'standard']
**confidence** | **float** | Confidence level for prediction intervals, shared by every node | [optional] [default to 0.8]
**confidence_level** | **float** | Alias for &#x60;confidence&#x60;; if both are sent, &#x60;confidence&#x60; wins | [optional]
**series** | [**\ForecastAPI\Sdk\Model\GroupedForecastSeries[]**](GroupedForecastSeries.md) | The leaves of the hierarchy — one entry per combination of dimension values, each combination exactly once. Up to 200 series on a paid plan, 10 on the free tier. Aggregate levels are derived by the API and must not be sent. |
