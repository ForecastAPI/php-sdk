# # BatchForecastRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**series** | [**\ForecastAPI\Sdk\Model\BatchForecastSeries[]**](BatchForecastSeries.md) | The series to forecast — up to 100,000 per call on a paid plan, 10 on the free tier | [optional]
**file_key** | **string** | Instead of inline &#x60;series&#x60; — the key returned by /v2/batch/forecast/presign, after uploading a JSON file of the same shape as this request body (an object with a &#x60;series&#x60; array). Series from a file are validated as they are streamed: an invalid series fails that series, not the whole batch. | [optional]
**periods** | **int** | Default forecast horizon for series that don&#39;t set their own | [optional] [default to 6]
**frequency** | **string** | Default data frequency | [optional]
**data_type** | **string** | Default data type | [optional]
**model** | **string** | Forecasting engine for the whole batch (request-level only) | [optional] [default to 'standard']
**confidence** | **float** | Default confidence level for prediction intervals | [optional] [default to 0.8]
**confidence_level** | **float** | Alias for &#x60;confidence&#x60; | [optional]
**quantiles** | **float[]** | Decile levels to return per period — only deciles between 0.1 and 0.9 are accepted, because those are the levels every backend produces natively; anything finer would be interpolation served under a label the model never predicted. Adds a &#x60;quantiles&#x60; object to each forecast row alongside the usual bounds. Honoured by /v2/forecast and /v2/batch/forecast (request-level default or per-series override); rejected on grouped forecasts; ignored by other endpoints sharing this request shape. | [optional]
**value_bounds** | [**\ForecastAPI\Sdk\Model\ValueBounds**](ValueBounds.md) |  | [optional]
**adjustments** | [**\ForecastAPI\Sdk\Model\AdjustmentsInner[]**](AdjustmentsInner.md) | What-if scenario applied on top of the forecast (\&quot;assume we lose the enterprise deal\&quot;). Adjustments compose in array order — ×2 then +50 is not +50 then ×2. Each one moves the point, both bounds and any quantile fan together. Returns an &#x60;adjusted&#x60; block; the adjusted path is never stored or accuracy-tracked. Honoured by /v2/forecast and /v2/batch/forecast (request-level default or per-series override — period windows are checked against each series&#39; own horizon); rejected on grouped forecasts; ignored by other endpoints sharing this request shape. | [optional]
**accumulate** | [**\ForecastAPI\Sdk\Model\AccumulateOptions**](AccumulateOptions.md) |  | [optional]
